# Physically based rendering

This project aims to implement rasterizing based physically based rendering.

Currently, it can load glTF (.gltf/.glb) file and render it on the screen. The color is determined by local coordinate.
You can create glTF file using `export` feature in Blender. You should turn on `+Y up` and `camera`. The scene should have at least one camera.
